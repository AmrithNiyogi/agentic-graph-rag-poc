    "2. **File Suggestion** - Identifying relevant files for the knowledge graph\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a complete end-to-end multi-agent workflow for knowledge graph construction. The system:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Captures user intent** through conversational AI\n",
    "2. **Suggests relevant files** based on the user's goals\n",
    "3. **Proposes schemas** for both structured and unstructured data\n",
    "4. **Constructs the knowledge graph** using the approved plans\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "- **Multi-agent collaboration**: Each agent specializes in a specific aspect of the workflow\n",
    "- **State management**: Information flows seamlessly between agents\n",
    "- **User interaction**: Users can approve/reject suggestions at each step\n",
    "- **Flexible architecture**: Easy to extend with new agents or modify existing ones\n",
    "\n",
    "### To use this notebook:\n",
    "1. Update the `API_KEY` variable with your OpenAI API key\n",
    "2. For production use, replace the mock Neo4j implementation with real Neo4j connection\n",
    "3. Add your actual data files to the `data/` directory\n",
    "4. Run the complete workflow or test individual components\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture provides a solid foundation for building sophisticated knowledge graph construction systems with AI agents!"
